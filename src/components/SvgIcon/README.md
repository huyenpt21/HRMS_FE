# SVG

### This is a guideline on how to use SVG in the folder.

**The main files that you need to focus on are `selection.json` and `symbol-defs.svg`. They exported from [Icon Font & SVG Icon Sets ‚ùç IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io) where you can import external SVG files or choose built-in libraries from IconMoon and specifically, we can manage them effortlessly**

**When you would like to update/import a new icon, do the following:**
1. Go to [IconMoon App](https://icomoon.io/app/#/select).
2. Import icons from your existing JSON file (`selection.json`), otherwise a SVG file should be chosen.
3. From your set (icons), do import/delete/edit as your need
4. Click on "Generate SVG & More" and download selected icons
5. Finally, unzip your previous downloaded file, copy main files (`selection.json`, `symbol-defs.svg`) in this SVG folder to make updates.
